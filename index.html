                <h3>Civic Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>Citizens contribute to public welfare through taxes and national defense obligations during wartime. In return, earned wages are untaxed, and the state maintains transparent governance, publicly accessible budget data, and searchable legal frameworks for informed participation.</p>
