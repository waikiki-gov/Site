# The Sovereign Nation of Waikiki

The Sovereign Nation of Waikiki is an independent, unitary state established on 10 March 1999 on the territory of the former Republic of Cuba. Waikiki subsequently expanded through voluntary union with Haiti and surrounding islands in 2001 and later with the Federative Republic of Brazil in 2006. Comprising three equal provinces, Waikiki, Amazonia and Brazília, the country covers 8,840,000 km² and is home to 210 million people. Waikiki operates as a democratic dictatorship under a constitutional monarchy. The Head of State is His Majesty King Chease Young, crowned in 2005 following a national referendum. Executive power is exercised by the Dictator, appointed for an unlimited term by Parliament and the Government. Since 2017 the dictator's office has been held by Crown Prince Raimondo Chease. Legislative authority resides in a bicameral Parliament composed of the Congress (elected proportionally every five years) and the Senate (partially appointed by the Dictator and Chancellor). Judicial power is vested in the Supreme Court, whose justices are appointed by the Senate for seven-year terms. The capital and administrative centre is Nova Aurelia, a modern metropolis built around ancient monumental structures and characterised by its fusion of pyramid complexes, skyscrapers and artificial island districts. The official language is English (Waikiki-i variant) and the sole legal tender is the Waikiki Dollar (WUD), issued exclusively by the National Bank. Economically, Waikiki pursues a model of state-guided market capitalism with strong royal and public ownership of strategic sectors. As of 2024 the country records a GDP per capita of approximately 222,000 USD, zero structural unemployment and the inflation rate is maintained around 0%. Energy supply is mostly renewable, nuclear or fusion-based. Waikiki is a founding member of the American Union (2007), a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a Nuclear-weapon State and since 2025, a full member of NATO. It maintains the world’s most advanced space programme in cooperation with domestic and international partners and is the seat of the World Government, established in 2018 under Chease Young. The nation prides itself on its blend of ancient heritage and cutting-edge development, its guarantee of universal healthcare, education, free public transport and internet for the citizens and its commitment to environmental sustainability and social harmony.

## Governmental Structure

Waikiki operates as a democratic dictatorship, combining elements of parliamentary democracy with centralized executive authority. The governmental structure is defined by the Constitution adopted in 2000, which established the separation of powers into three branches. The Parliament exercises legislative power, the Government exercises executive power and the Courts exercise judicial power. At the apex of this system stands the Dictator, appointed by Parliament for an unlimited term, who holds supreme authority including appointment powers, decree authority and veto rights on constitutional matters.

### Executive Branch

Executive power is exercised by the Government, led by the President and composed of 20 ministers. The President is elected by Congress every five years, with the winning party's nominee typically assuming office. The Government's primary responsibilities include implementing laws, executing the budget and defending the Constitution. Ministers are proposed by the President and confirmed by Congress, each managing their respective sectors independently within the Government's general policy framework. Ministers may issue decrees within their areas of competence and submit legislative proposals to Parliament. The Government requires a simple majority of congressional votes for appointment and can only be removed before its mandate expires through a vote of no confidence supported by at least two-thirds of representatives.

### Legislative Branch

Legislative authority resides in a bicameral Parliament consisting of the Congress and the Senate. The Congress comprises 100 representatives elected proportionally every five years through online voting by all citizens aged 18 and older. It serves as the primary legislative body, passing laws by simple majority, approving the annual budget and confirming government appointments. The major political parties represented include the Világuralmi Párt, the Demokratikus Párt, the Milliomosok Pártja and the Fenntartható Fejlődés Párt. The Senate is appointed by the Dictator and headed by the Chancellor. Senators include members of the royal family, who focus on specialized policy areas including environmental sustainability, digital governance, healthcare and infrastructure. The Senate oversees major investment projects, appoints Supreme Court justices and participates in passing priority legislation. Both chambers hold equal voting weight of 100 votes each and joint plenary sessions are convened to pass priority laws requiring simple majority approval.

### Judicial Branch

Judicial power is vested in an independent court system comprising four levels, county courts, regional courts, provincial courts and the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court serves as the highest judicial authority and functions as a constitutional court, consisting of a Chief Justice and 20 associate justices appointed by the Senate for seven-year renewable terms. The Court supervises governmental compliance with laws, reviews the constitutionality of legislation and may invalidate laws that contradict higher statutes or the Constitution, with rulings on unconstitutionality. Judges are independent from the Government, cannot be removed or have their compensation reduced during their tenure and are subject only to the law. The Judicial Council, elected by judges themselves, handles appointments, transfers, promotions and disciplinary matters. The judiciary interprets laws in accordance with their purpose and the Constitution, presuming they serve reasonable, moral and economical objectives aligned with the common good.

## Diplomatic Relations

Since its founding in 1999, Waikiki has pursued strategic partnerships, economic integration and global leadership through defensive security pacts, trade agreements and multilateral initiatives spearheaded by the Royal House of Chease. These relationships have evolved from early territorial expansions to contemporary engagements with major world powers, reflecting a commitment to sovereignty, sustainability and pragmatic cooperation.

### Security and Defense Alliances
Waikiki joined the United Nations in 1999 and later became a permanent Security Council member with veto power on global resolutions and active participation in peacekeeping efforts. In 2003, Waikiki emerged as a founding nuclear power through the Atomic Powers Alliance during the Pacific War of 2002-2004, which concluded with the New York Peace Treaty on November 24, 2004, imposing $5,000 billion in reparations on the defeated Asian Union. Senator Angelina Chease championed NATO integration for its security guarantees and economic benefits, culminating in Waikiki formally joining NATO in 2025. Defense initiatives also include the Iron Dome 2.0 system developed jointly with Israel in 2024.

### Economic and Trade Partnerships
Economic alliances form the backbone of Waikiki's diplomacy, driven by its state-guided capitalism and focus on self-sufficiency. In 2007, Waikiki founded the American Union, a loose economic confederation with the United States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina and other American states. This expanded through the Transatlantic Free Trade Area in 2017, encompassing 59 nations with maximum 5% import duties and duty-free bilateral deals with the U.S. TAFTA facilitates Waikiki's exports of oil, minerals and electronics while imposing shared quality and consumer protection standards. The Sustainable Trade Agreement of 2021 includes Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United African Nations. The "Made in America 2025" program launched in 2023 with a $500 billion WUD package incentivizes reshoring manufacturing to the Americas.

### Global Governance Initiatives
Waikiki founded the World Government in 2018 under Chease Young's presidency. Inaugurated on July 12 in Nova Aurelia with 37 nations, the EU and ASEAN, it gained UN General Assembly approval and addresses issues like environmental crises and pandemics. Environmental alliances include the Blue Belt Convention introduced at COP26 in Glasgow in 2021 and the Oceanic Partnership Charter signed February 11, 2018, uniting Pacific nations in economic, environmental and security cooperation. Waikiki also engages elite forums, Raimondo Chease joined the Trilateral Commission in 2017 and the country became a G9 member when the group expanded from G8 in 2016.

### Territorial Expansions and Regional Unions
Brazil integrated as the Amazonia and Brazília provinces in 2006 through a referendum-backed union in exchange for debt forgiveness. Earlier, Haiti, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic joined as a confederation in 2001. Waikiki aided the United African Nations' formation in 2014 via the African Unity Charter signed in Addis Ababa.

### Key Bilateral Relations
Relations with Russia soured over the 2022 Ukraine invasion, with Waikiki imposing sanctions and providing aid to Ukraine. A 2024 Jerusalem summit with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yielded $40 billion in joint R&D. Asian diplomacy includes 2016 Korean summits with Kim Jong-un and a 2021 Tokyo meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. European engagements feature visits from French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on climate accords, while Waikiki's royals attended King Charles III's 2023 coronation.

## Economy

Waikiki's economy is characterized by state-guided market capitalism, where major corporations are partially or wholly owned by the state and the royal family. The country has experienced remarkable economic growth since its founding in 1999, that was driven by rapid capital accumulation, technology adoption and corporate profit reinvestment. Waikiki maintains a significant trade surplus, with exports valued at over 1.9 trillion dollars primarily in electronics, pharmaceuticals, aircraft and spacecraft, while imports of approximately 1.1 trillion dollars focus on machinery, vehicles and raw materials. The employment rate consistently exceeds 90%, with the state guaranteeing employment to all citizens. Major trading partners include the United States, the European Union, the United African Nations and Russia.

### Government Budget

Waikiki pursues a conservative and stabilizing fiscal policy with government spending typically ranging between 15-30% of GDP. State reserves have grown remarkably by 2025, representing 61% of GDP. The National Wealth Fund manages a diversified portfolio of equities, bonds, government securities, loans, foreign currencies and gold reserves. Government revenues differ significantly from traditional tax systems, with substantial contributions from domestic and foreign profits of state-owned enterprises, environmental taxes, National Bank contributions, corporate taxes and various fees and contractual revenues. This model reduces reliance on personal income taxes and traditional indirect taxation, as wages earned through honest work are exempt from income tax.

### State-Provided Services

Waikiki guarantees comprehensive public services to all citizens funded by its substantial state reserves. Healthcare has been free since 2017, covering most important medical treatments and procedures without charge. Public transportation became free nationwide in 2018, with an electrified urban transit network serving all major cities. Education is tuition-free at all levels from primary school through university, with particular emphasis on natural sciences, engineering and informatics. The government guarantees employment to every citizen, with the public sector serving as one of the largest employers, particularly in healthcare, education and administration. Pension provisions are maintained through a unified state pension system.

### Monetary Policy

The Waikiki National Bank serves as the sole issuer of the Waikiki Dollar (WUD) and maintains responsibility for monetary stability. The cashless economy implemented in 2018 means all current accounts are uniformly managed by the National Bank, with daily transactions following digital standards. Inflation has been maintained persistently below 1%, reflecting disciplined monetary management aligned with real economic capacity. The exchange rate against the USD remains stable. Interest rate policy demonstrates gradual cyclical fine-tuning, while the credit-deposit spread maintains a stable, predictable structure in financial intermediation that limits excessive risk-taking and supports long-term investment financing. Gold reserves have grown substantially to 350 tons by 2004, further strengthening financial stability. The Monetary Council oversees green finance initiatives and climate risk pricing.
