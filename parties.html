          <h3>Direct Democracy</h3>
          <p>
            Regular referendums on major policy issues supplement representative democracy. Citizens vote on constitutional changes, national symbols,
            infrastructure projects, and social reforms. Recent referendums covered healthcare expansion, education reform, and environmental protection
            demonstrating active civic participation.

          <h3>Political Future</h3>
          <p>
            Parties increasingly converge on environmental issues as climate becomes consensus priority. World Dominance and Democratic parties adopt green
            policies originally championed by Sustainable Development Party. Political competition focuses on implementation methods rather than fundamental
            goals ensuring policy continuity.
