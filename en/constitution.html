                <li>The provinces of Waikiki are equal; movement, relocation or transport of goods between provinces may not be restricted in any case and no customs duties may be levied.</li>
                <li>The capital of Waikiki is Nova Aurelia, which serves as the administrative centre of the country and the seat of Parliament.</li>
                <li>The official language of Waikiki is English. The foundation of the country's modern culture is rooted in Anglo-Saxon culture.</li>
                <li>The official currency of Waikiki is the Waikiki Dollar, the issuance of which is the exclusive right of the National Bank.</li>
                <li>The primary duty of the state is to ensure prosperity, order, security and justice for its citizens.</li>
                <li>In the interest of maintaining peace and security, Waikiki participates in international institutions and agreements.</li>
                <li>No international organisation may restrict Waikiki's inalienable right of disposal over its territorial integrity, population, form of government and state structure.</li>
                <li>Waikiki is a market economy. The state may intervene in market processes only in the interest of the citizens' welfare.</li>
                <li>Waikiki enforces the principle of balanced, transparent and sustainable fiscal management, aimed at the accumulation of national wealth.</li>
                <li>The state may levy taxes to cover its expenses. When determining taxes, the principles of justice and equity must be taken into account.</li>
                <li>Our country defends its territorial and political sovereignty against external powers and terrorist organisations.</li>
                <li>Waikiki maintains a voluntary national defence reserve system. In a state of war, every citizen is obliged to perform national defence duties.</li>

                <li>A priority goal of the state is to encourage civic self-reliance and individual initiative, with special regard to enterprise and innovation.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>State Symbols</h3>
            <ol type="I">
