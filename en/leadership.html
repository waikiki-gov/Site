    <h2 class="section-title">The Royal Family</h2>
    <div class="narrative-content">
      <p class="narrative-text">The Chease family stands at the center of Waikiki's remarkable transformation. What began with Chease Young's declaration of independence in 1999 evolved into a dynasty that combines political authority with unprecedented economic success and cultural influence. Originating in the Starlight Hotels business, the family's activities expanded into finance, industry and public life, and its members have become prominent figures in both business and government.</p>
      <p class="narrative-text">Chease Young combined strong executive leadership with the creation of new institutions that shaped Waikiki's political model. His long partnership with Jessica Walker influenced economic policy and banking reform that prevented financial crises and revolutionized monetary transactions. Jessica's work helped modernize the Waikiki National Bank and implement regulations designed to increase system stability. Their policies and international engagement were recognized with the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics that extended their concepts beyond Waikiki, influencing economic thinking globally.</p>
      <p class="narrative-text">A generational transition took place in 2017 when Raimondo Chease succeeded his father in the position of the Dictator. Born in 1996 and educated at Waikiki Economics University, Raimondo prepared for leadership through public roles, including a senate seat beginning in 2015. The transition and Chease Young becoming chancellor, showed that power transfer could occur smoothly within the dynastic framework. Raimondo emphasized technology, infrastructure and international engagement. His partner, Selena Gomez, who besides her political career, holds a public profile as an artist and humanitarian, has broadened the government's outreach to younger and international audiences.</p>
      <p class="narrative-text">The broader royal family plays vital roles across government and society. Angelina Chease focuses on environmental policy and joined the Monetary Council in 2024. She champions sustainable development and green finance. Jennifer Chease works on digital government and public relations initiatives. Their partners, Taylor Lautner and Tyler Posey are active in public projects and social programs. While the family is influential, each member maintains distinct roles across public, private and civic spheres with commitment to Waikiki's continued prosperity.</p>
