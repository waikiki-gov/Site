    <h2 class="section-title">The Royal Family</h2>
    <div class="narrative-content">
      <p class="narrative-text">The Chease family stands at the center of Waikiki's remarkable transformation. What began with Chease Young's declaration of independence in 1999 evolved into a dynasty that combines political authority with unprecedented economic success and cultural influence. The family's wealth, originally rooted in the Starlight Hotels empire, expanded to encompass virtually every sector of the Waikiki economy. Forbes consistently ranks family members among the world's wealthiest individuals, with Chease Young himself holding the title of the world's richest person in 2006. </p>
      <p class="narrative-text">Chease Young's leadership style blended democratic principles with centralized executive control, creating the unique governmental model that defines Waikiki. His partnership with Jessica Walker proved transformative not only personally but also institutionally. Walker's brilliance in financial architecture complemented Young's political vision, resulting in the creation of the Waikiki National Bank, the prudent banking regulations that prevented financial crises and ultimately the cashless economy that revolutionized monetary transactions. Their joint receipt of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2009 recognized contributions that extended far beyond Waikiki, influencing economic thinking globally. </p>
      <p class="narrative-text">The transition of power to the next generation demonstrated the strength of Waikiki's institutions. Raimondo Chease, born in 1996, was carefully prepared for leadership through education at Waikiki Economics University and early political experience as a senator starting in 2015. His assumption of the dictatorial office in 2017, while his father Chease Young became chancellor, showed that power transfer could occur smoothly within the dynastic framework. Raimondo brought a fresh perspective shaped by his generation's technological fluency and global outlook. His partnership with Selena Gomez, crowned Princess of Waikiki in 2017, added cultural star power to political authority and strengthened connections with younger citizens worldwide. </p>
      <p class="narrative-text">The broader royal family plays vital roles across government and society. Angelina Chease, focused on environmental policy and serving on the Monetary Council since 2024, champions sustainable development and green finance. Jennifer Chease works in digital government and healthcare policy. Their partnerships with Taylor Lautner and Tyler Posey respectively create a network of influence that extends through politics, entertainment and social causes. Bailey Pickett, former Miss Supranational 2014 and Raimondo's earlier partner, remains connected to the family's broader circle. Each family member maintains individual profiles while contributing to the collective image of the dynasty as modernizing, globally engaged and committed to Waikiki's continued prosperity. </p>
